                            I'm a passionate front-end developer who loves to write code, based in Montreal,
                            Canada. I enjoy learning and mastering new web technologies which always motivates
                            me to go in depth of these technologies.
                            <br /><br />
                            The one thing which I love the most about web development is JavaScript, as Iâ€™m
                            always curious to learn and explore new concepts and ways of writing short syntaxes
                            of JavaScript which makes the code more readable and logical. I like declarative
                            style of coding with es6 syntax of JavaScript.
                            <br /><br />
                            More hooks of my web development are HTML5, CSS3, JS (Loved the most), RWD
                            (Responsive Web Design), SASS, React. I like to be in touch with backend technologies
                            like Node.js, MongoDb. GitHub is my favourite platform where I like to organize and
                            upload my projects.
                            <br /><br />
                            In my leisure time, I love to explore new REST APIs by testing out them in one of my
                            favourite tools, which is Postman, and reading popular and trending articles on Medium.
